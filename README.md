### Product Page

Dynamic product rendering using JavaScript

"Load More" button to display products in chunks

Loader animation until page and products are ready

### How It Works

On page load, the loader is displayed until products are rendered.

The "Load More" button appends the next batch of products.

When all products are displayed, the button is hidden.
